Tasks

0. README, AUTHORS (a REAME and Authors file for the project)

1. Be pycodestyle compliant!(a beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.)

2. Unittests (for files, classes, functions)

3. BaseModel (a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes)

4. Create BaseModel from dictionary(re-create an instance with this dictionary representation)

5. Store first object (recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation)

6. Console 0.0.1 (a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter)

7. Console 0.1 (Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands)

8. First User (a class User that inherits from BaseModel)

9. More classes! (Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel)


10. Console 1.0 (Updates FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review)

11. All instances by class name (Update command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve all instances of a class by using: <class name>.all())

12. Count instances (Updates command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve the number of instances of a class: <class name>.count())

13. Show (Update command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve an instance based on its ID: <class name>.show(<id>).) Errors management is the same as previously.

14. Destroy (Update command interpreter (console.py) to destroy an instance based on his ID: <class name>.destroy(<id>).) Errors management is the same as previously.

15. Update( Update command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID: <class name>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>). Errors management is the same as previously.

16. Update from dictionary Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID with a dictionary: <class name>.update(<id>, <dictionary representation>). Errors management is the same as previously.

17. Unittests for the Console! (Write all unittests for console.py, all features! For testing the console,  “intercept” STDOUT of it, )
